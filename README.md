## Overview

This repository contains a SMART live trading bot for multi-stock, multi-agent reinforcement learning (FinRL) with Tiger Brokers API integration.  
Key features include:

- **Multi-agent support:** Uses PPO, A2C, and SAC models (trained with [FinRL](https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation/FinRL)).
- **Live trading:** Connects to Tiger Brokers for real-time execution.
- **Daily stop-loss:** Prevents excessive losses by comparing account value to previous day.
- **Rolling Sharpe selection:** Dynamically picks the best-performing model.
- **Capital-aware execution:** Trades are limited by available cash and position sizes.
- **Comprehensive logging:** Logs trades, errors, and account status to `smart_trading_bot.log` and `smart_trading_bot_error.log` in  `log` folder.
- **Transaction history:** Saves daily transaction summaries in `transaction_actions/`.
